## Information about this project
In September of 2022, Spillpedagogene wrote an article ([Skriftlige innspill til Regjeringens Spillstrategi](https://www.spillpedagogene.no/2022/09/01/skriftlige-innspill-til-regjeringens-spillstrategi/)) regarding the logistical struggles of using games in education. Traditionally distribution of games is done by physical medium such as USB drives, or limited to browser based games. This project aims to simplify distribution by providing a way to centralize the game library using a web interface, allowing you to both manage and distribute your own internal game library.
