# Contribution
Improvements are very welcome, feel free to open a pull request or issue. The frontend in general is a bit of a mess, so feel free to improve it. Design is not my strong suit.

Keep in mind this project is aimed towards teachers, so it should be easy to use and understand. Performance or fancy features are not a priority, simplicity is.

## About the modules
The project is built on Node.js, and uses Express for the backend and Pug for the frontend. The database is SQLite, which for now is managed using NocoDB (which is a web-based database manager). The reason for this is that it is easy to use, and it is relatively easy for anyone to manage the database using the web interface.
