# Personalization
The frontend can be personalized by changing the files in the `cfg` folder. The `cfg` folder is mounted to the frontend container, so any changes you make to the files will be reflected on the frontend.

> [!NOTE]+
> Updating config may require a restart of the frontend container.

Feel free to contribute any changes you make to the frontend by creating a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sondregronas/EduGameDist).
